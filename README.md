## Libraries Used

-   Axios
-   use-axios-client

## How I worked on this project

-   I used 'css modules' for styling
-   Used 'use-axios-client' an axios library, to handle HTTP requests.

## How to navigate this project

-   Each individual components can be found inside the components folder
-   The pages can be found in the pages folder
-   All styles can be found in the styles folder

## Why I built the project this way

-   The application fetches Real Time Coronavirus cases data data from the [diseases api](https://disease.sh/docs/#/)
-   I used 'use-axios-client', an Axios library which make HTTP request and handling error easier. This helped me get to know how Axios work and how to use it.
